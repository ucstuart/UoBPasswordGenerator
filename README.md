# Random Password Generator

# Introduction

During this assignment we were provided with Starter Code, which included a number of arrays of different types of characters that would be used for the generation of a random password, to the users required length. 

I have maintained the ability to run this code in either Production P or Testing T environments, the Testing Environment outputs more data to the console logging which has proved very helpful for debugging.
